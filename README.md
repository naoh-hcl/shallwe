Yeah, 
The code in the hel.py actually create a reverse shell inside the target. 
Even it is a windows or linux operating system


But the windows reverse shell is less stable than the linux.

You can recieve the reverse shell by using netcat in your machine.(possibly you knew about that, didn't you?)

Remember you need to change the ip address and port manually in the code.



Everyone is welcome to suggests how to stable the windows reverse shell.
